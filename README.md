# Catchall Forecasting Approach to Online Portfolio Selection

In this Master's Thesis Twitter as representative of social networks that capture state of
the modern world and public mood will be used for enhancement of state-of-the-art trading
strategy, namely, Combination Forecasting Reversion (CFR) strategy, which, in turn, combines
several statistical models for investment portfolio creation and rebalancing. In
such a way a so-called "catchall" approach which unites information from historical data with
information prevailing in people's minds at every particular moment will be created. This
"catchall" strategy aims to additionally capture the main feature of the modern world - fast
information spread and instant access to it.
The main outcome of Mater's Thesis is enhancement of the most recent state-of-the-art
trading strategy through embedding of sentiment analysis component into it. Performance of
enhanced strategy together with performance of baseline strategies is tested on Foreign
Exchange market (FOREX), which brings an additional novelty to this work as almost all trading
strategies were initially created for stock market and have not been fully tested on currency
market. Finally, Graphical User Interface (GUI) was created for fast and convenient testing of trading
strategies on FOREX.
